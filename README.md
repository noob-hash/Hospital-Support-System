In hospital, it is difficult to keep track of every patient data. These data are specially related to patients’ 
medical history, allergies, etc. Such data are important because they can be used as reference points for patients’ 
health and for study purposes. 

Hospital Support System (HSS) is a web application designed to store patient record data like past medical history, 
report, allergies, etc. such that the data can be easily accessed, shared, and viewed. It is a very useful application 
for large hospitals as they need to manage a large amount of information abut patient which can easily be lost or 
mismanaged which can affect the overall healthcare a patient can get. As such, Hospital Support System can help both 
doctor and patient by keeping track of data and by making the information easy to access. It is a combination of web 
portal and database with graphical user interface to make it easier to use for any person. Doctors can use it for 
retrieving and updating information while users use it to make an appointment and retrieve the online report and 
diagnosis through web.
